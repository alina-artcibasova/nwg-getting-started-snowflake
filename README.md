# Snowpark Handson-Lab for Credit Card Approval Prediction

You are part of a team of data engineers and data scientists at a banking company that has been tasked to identify high-risk customers using a machine learning based solution. The goal is to give a recommendation to either approve or reject the issueing of a credit card.

To build this, you have access to customer demographic and credit history data. Using Snowpark, we will ingest, analyze and transform this data to train a model that will then be deployed inside Snowflake to score new data.

The dataset you are using is part of a Kaggle competition that can be found here:
